        Code-Operative was a co-operative founded in 2017 in the North East of England. The co-operative was closed in 2024 and replaced by <a href="https://sepheo.co/">SEPHEO</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Code-Operative's mission was to grant its members a greater degree of autonomy over their economic lives - both by exposing new
        people to the benefits of freelancing and in exposing freelancers to the benefits of mutualisation within the co-operative model,
        via a greater degree of security and autonomy in their work and via a support network. Our clients were tech-for-good, typically
        themselves co-operatives or non-profit organisations.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2024 its members decided to dissolve Code-Operative, feeling that the organisation (and in particular the legal structure) had
        served its purpose in the pusuit of the aforementioned goals.
        The purpose of this webpage is to serve as a history of Code-Operative, a retrospective of successes and failures to learn from in
        the co-operative movement, and as a sign-post to direct people to the diverse new efforts being undertaken as a result of Code-Operative's
        existence. In many ways this page is a celebration of our co-operative, written by former members.
    </p>
    <p>
        For many of its members, it was their first foray into the co-operative movement (a business owned and controlled by its workers),
        and their first experience running a business. For more than 20 people, Code-Operative provided their first steps into the co-operative movement,
        and often the first steps in a technology career, providing them with the experience and tools they needed to go on to find their place in
        society, and improve their quality of life. It is a venture that we are immensely proud of.

    <h2>Why SEPHEO?</h2>
    <p>
        Code-Operative was a great vehicle for learning and in particular exploring how the coop and coop-adjacent tech sector operated.
        However after a few years we found ourselves having to choose between 3 incompatible business models.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Connecting our freelancer members to roles, like a recruitment agency.</li>
        <li>Bidding and managing projects like a consultancy.</li>
        <li>Selling automated services and products.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We sampled each of these models to various degrees, but to succeed at any of them required giving up the other two,
        because we needed to have a clear and simple mission to explain externally and internally what we do. Each model implies a different structure 
        and different responsibilities on the part of the members, and we decided that choosing one was better than avoiding choosing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of our income to that point had come from behaving like an agency and a consultancy, so selling products wasn't a strong candidate for the group
        as it existed in that moment. We decided against becoming a consultancy because there are already several tech coops that operate in that way,
        and we felt that they were already catering this need.
    </p>
    <p>
        We decided to focus entirely on model 1, connecting members to roles with other coops and aligned organisations.
        It made the most sense to reform around this model, because Code-Operative had years of documents and history that was now irrelevant,
        and a few members of code-op weren't interested in being part of the next organisation. So we distributed the remaining assets of Code-Op and closed it, and opened SEPHEO.
    </p>
    <p>
        SEPHEO stands for Self-Employed People Helping Each Other, and is in the process of providing a cooperative structure for the cloud of freelancers that orbit the various tech cooperatives in the UK and beyond.
        We act as a visible point of attraction for people who want to enter the coop economy, and as a trusted partner for coops to get people from. We want to ease the capacity problems that can plague small coop busineses by providing a collective solution.
        By aggregating the freelancers and coops, SEPHEO acts as a shock absorber, smoothing out the flow of work, making business development more predictable and easier to plan ahead for.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal is to stabilise and grow the coop economy by matching opportunities within coops to those eager to join the coop world. There are a lot of amazing people out there and we want to help you meet them.

        From the original four founders of Code-Operative, to all of the people who helped to build the co-op into a success, and to all of our wonderful clients and
        fellow co-operatives, there are a lot of people to thank. Code-Operative was incubated by a rich co-operative ecosystem, and for the reader we wanted this website
        to attempt a sort of cartography of some of those excellent initiatives:
