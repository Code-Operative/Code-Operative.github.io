    <h2>Our Structure</h2>

    <p>
        We are a non-profit service co-operative, meaning that our members own equal
        shares in the venture and Code-Operative's commission is only ever enough to
        cover its running costs. This means our members can enjoy the benefits of
        collaboration whilst retaining the benefits of being self employed.
        Our commission rate is currently {{site.commission_rate}}
